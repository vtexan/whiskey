I like whiskey (a lot), and whisky depending on where it's from. I generally drink bourbon but I'm equal opportunity. This repo is where I'll keep some notes on the Whiskey that I have, have tried, still want to obtain, etc. Over time I may even get clever and start organizing them in meaningful ways for both myself and for you. Open to suggestions! By the way, I totally stole this idea from Josh Atwell, you can fork his work from here: https://github.com/joshatwell/whiskey 

Opinions on spirits vary, but I"ll consider this an outline based on MY preferences, in case you wondered what I liked to drink. I'll put the ones that make me smile the most in **bold**.

Finally, I don't have a drinking problem. I have a whiskey buying problem. Drinking problem means your recycle bin is full. My problem means I need a bigger liquor cabinet. :-)

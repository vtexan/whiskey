# Atlanta
Park Bar - Nice whiskey offering

# Boulder, CO
West End Tavern - Excellent flights

# Las Vegas, NV

The Whiskey Attic
This one is a little trickier. To visit this place you need to get a group and set up an appointment. Visiting includes a great tasting based on your flavor preferences. It's about $100/person and worth it for a great tasting experience. I attend this at EMC World 2016 - it was awesome, hight recommended with a group of like minded individuals !

Foundation - Great "hidden" spot for excellent cocktails

Pecadillo | Carrboro, NC - **Amazing bartenders**

# Atlanta
Park Bar - Nice whiskey offering

# Boulder, CO
Canyon's Restaurant and bar (part of Marriott Hotel) - Great old fashioned
West End Tavern - Excellent flights

# Las Vegas, NV

The Whiskey Attic
This one is a little trickier. To visit this place you need to get a group and set up an appointment. Visiting includes a great tasting based on your flavor preferences. It's about $100/person and worth it for a great tasting experience.

# West Palm Beach, FL
Blue Martini
The old fashioned they made me included a rock candy stick. It was a cool way to include the sugar. Given how my evening there went I'm sure they pour heavy. Keep that in mind if you determine you don't like their cocktails. :-)
